## sound-to-2D-image
# A Science of Music project undertaken at Warwick university.
Thomas Dove: "The main idea of the project is seeing if it is possible to train your brain to be able to perceive a simple image through only audio, and studying how space-filling curves can be used to intuitively map a 1 dimensional audio signal onto 2 dimensional image."
